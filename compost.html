		<p class="card-text"><p>When food scraps enter landfills, they are deprived of the oxygen needed to safely decompose. Instead, methane is released into the air.<p>
		Making compost helps to reduce the amount of food waste entering landfills and in turn, reduces the release of methane and your carbon footprint.<p>
		Composting enriches soil, helping to retain moisture and suppress plant diseases and pests. It reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and encourages the production of natural bacteria and fungi that break down the food waste in hummus, the soil-like product of composting.<p>
		All compost is composed of carbon-rich (brown) materials, oxygen-rich (green) materials and water. Nitrogen rich items include scraps like fruits, vegetables and grass clippings. Carbon rich materials include dry leaves, paper and straw.<p>
		Composting is one of the most effective ways to mitigate your food waste. While most food scraps can be diverted from the trash bin, there are definitely items that shouldn't enter a home compost bin. On a larger scale, many of these items can also be composted..</p>

				</div>
				<!--top-->
				<div class="bottom">
					<p>While items like cheese, yogurt and milk can be processed on a large scale, you should avoid putting them into your compost bin at home. The rotting will attract pests.Dairy products are usually rich in fat, which slows down the composting processs.</p>

					<div class="clicker">Newspaper, cotton rounds, cardboard, yard trimmings</div>

					<p>These items are rich in carbon, which is one of two crucial elements for a successful compost. Shred or cut up these items as small as you can to expedite the process.

				</div>
				<!--top-->
				<div class="bottom">
					<p>As with dairy, meat can be processed on a large scale, but should be avoided at home due to attracting pests. Adding meat to your compost can also cause it to smell bad. Some smell is normal due to the inherit nature of decomposition. This smell can be mananged by turning your compost often to reintroduce oxygen to the pile.</p>

					<p>Compost loves coffee! Collect your coffee grounds in a container to add to your compost. Some plants that enjoy a more acidic soil will also appreciate coffee grounds. Coffe is rich in nitrogen, a vital element to composting.
