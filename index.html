	<h1>Food Waste in America</h1>
	<p>Food spoilage is one of the biggest reasons Americans throw out food, with the main cause being the misunderstanding surrounding expiration labels.<br>
Food in the US is plentiful and cheap, which contributes to Americans not appreciating or valuing the food they consume compared to other cultures around the world.<br>
Americans are also impulsive in food purchases, and often overestimate how much food they need, leading them to overbuy. This leads to more food spoiling and in turn, more food waste. <br>
Food decomposing in landfills produces a deadly greenhouse gas: methane. However, the impact does not begin here. Energy and resources are expended from the time the food is planted in the ground to traveling to when it's cooked in your kitchen and passes through your stomach.
