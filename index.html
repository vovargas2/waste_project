	<h1>Food Waste in America</h1>
	<p class="lead">
The total generation of municpal solid waste in America in 2018 was 292.4 million tons, according to the <a href=https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#composting>EPA.</a>
</p>

<p>Food spoilage is one of the biggest reasons Americans throw out food, with the main cause being the misunderstanding surrounding expiration labels.<br>
Food in the US is plentiful and cheap, which contributes to Americans not appreciating or valuing the food they consume compared to other cultures around the world.<br>
Americans are also impulsive in food purchases, and often overestimate how much food they need, leading them to overbuy. This leads to more food spoiling and in turn, more food waste. <br>
Food decomposing in landfills produces a deadly greenhouse gas: methane. However, the impact does not begin here. Energy and resources are expended from the time the food is planted in the ground to traveling to when it's cooked in your kitchen and passes through your stomach.

				<p class="card-text"><p>When food scraps enter landfills, they are deprived of the oxygen needed to safely decompose. Instead, methane is released into the air.<br>
Making compost helps to reduce the amount of food waste entering landfills and in turn, reduces the release of methane and your carbon footprint.<br>Composting is one of the most effective ways to mitigate your food waste. While most food scraps can be diverted from the trash bin, there are definitely items that shouldn't enter a home compost bin.
